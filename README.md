# Meaning

Are you an avid reader? Or just a average joe who reads occasionally?

Either way I'm pretty sure that you have encounter words every day that you don't know about. And what do you do about it?
We usually skip past them because we are too lazy to use a dictionary or open a new tab and do a quick google search.

Don't worry, Meaning chrome extension is here to your rescue. Just activate the extension with a single click, and highlight the
word that you want to know more about. You'll get everything you need in the split of a second.
